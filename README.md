# Travel Tracker

Travel Tracker is an app that tracks a user's previous travels.
Each user can input locations they have been and the date for that location.
A user can add, update, and delete any trips, and has access to all trip information for their login.

HTML, CSS, Handlebars, JavaScript, Bootstrap.


## Planning
I followed General Assembly's suggested schedule. I started by building back end (please refer to back-end repo linked above for more detailed information). For this front end I began by creating all of the authorization for sign up, sign in, change password and sign out. As they were created I ensured each action had a response message for the user to see. I then added forms for a user to create their travel. I then made sure a user could view they're inputting travel, and only for their login. I made sure a user could then update the date or location of a current travel, and finally made sure a user can delete their travel. Each action has a success or failure message.

## Unsolved Problems
I would like to find a better color scheme for the whole web page itself, and style it better.
For future versions I would like to have a title for each travel and also experiences for those travels.
I have a lot of stretch goals for this project for future versions.
